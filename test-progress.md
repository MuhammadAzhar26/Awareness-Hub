## Testing Progress

### Step 1: Pre-Test Planning
- Website complexity: Complex MPA with interactive quiz system
- Test strategy: Technical verification + Manual testing checklist
- Focus: New quiz auto-pause feature

### Step 2: Technical Verification
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

#### Deployment Check
- ✅ Site accessible (HTTP 200)
- ✅ All static assets loading

#### Database Verification
- ✅ Wireshark Stage 1: 3 quizzes at 30%, 60%, 90%
- ✅ Quiz questions correctly formatted (multiple_choice, fill_blank, drag_drop)
- ✅ Trigger timestamps: 120s, 240s, 360s
- ✅ Transcript data: 4 sections with time ranges 0-30s, 30-120s, 120-240s, 240-360s
- ✅ 6 modules fully populated: 14 quizzes, 14 questions, 21 transcripts

#### Code Implementation Review
- ✅ YouTube IFrame API loading (lines 86-97)
- ✅ Player initialization with event handlers (lines 200-234)
- ✅ Time-based quiz checking (every 1 second) (lines 257-272)
- ✅ Auto-pause on quiz trigger (line 289)
- ✅ Auto-resume on quiz complete (line 315)
- ✅ Transcript timestamp navigation (lines 300-305)
- ✅ Points RPC integration (lines 320-327)

### Step 3: Coverage Validation
- [✅] Database structure validated
- [✅] Quiz trigger logic verified
- [✅] Video pause/resume logic verified
- [✅] Transcript panel implementation verified
- [⚠️] Browser-based E2E testing blocked (tool unavailable)

### Step 4: Manual Testing Required
**Browser Testing Tools Status**: ❌ UNAVAILABLE (ECONNREFUSED ::1:9222)

**Alternative Verification**: Technical review completed successfully

**Recommendation**: Manual testing using checklist in QUIZ_SYSTEM_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md

| Component | Technical Status | Manual Test Required |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Database | ✅ Verified | ❌ N/A |
| Code Logic | ✅ Verified | ❌ N/A |
| Quiz Auto-Pause | ✅ Code Correct | ✅ YES - Test at 2:00 mark |
| Video Resume | ✅ Code Correct | ✅ YES - Test after quiz |
| Transcript Navigation | ✅ Code Correct | ✅ YES - Click timestamps |
| Code Copying | ✅ Code Correct | ✅ YES - Test copy buttons |

**Final Status**: ✅ TECHNICALLY VERIFIED - Manual UX testing recommended
